# calendates
Store data about events throughout the year

This calendar helps people keep track of holidays and major events throughout the coming years. It is designed to allow multiple people to work on the same calendar. It can especially be helpful for groups of friends or businesses with organising dates.

Once repo is cloned, add_data.py can be run to help pre-fill the calendar database with public events ('python add_data.py' into command line). Then use python to run project.py ('python project.py'). Finally visit http://localhost:8000/ to begin browsing.
