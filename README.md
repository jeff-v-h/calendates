# calendates
Store data about events throughout the year

This calendar helps people keep track of holidays and major events throughout the coming years. It is designed to allow multiple people to work on the same calendar. It can especially be helpful for groups of friends or businesses with organising dates.

Once repo is cloned, add_data.py can be run after the database is setup to help pre-fill the calendar with public events.
